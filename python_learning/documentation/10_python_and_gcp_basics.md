## **10. Python and GCP Basics**

### **Introduction**

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a variety of services, including compute, storage, networking, and machine learning resources. Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries, allows you to automate and interact with GCP services effectively. This chapter will cover the basics of working with Python and GCP, setting up the environment, and using Python to interact with basic GCP resources.

### **1. Setting Up GCP SDK and Authentication**

Before you start using Python with GCP, you need to set up the Google Cloud SDK and authenticate your environment.

#### **Step 1: Install the Google Cloud SDK**

The Google Cloud SDK is a set of tools that allow you to interact with GCP services from the command line. Install the SDK by following the instructions provided by Google: [Install Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

```bash
# For example, on Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
```

#### **Step 2: Authenticate with Google Cloud**

Once installed, authenticate your environment using the `gcloud` CLI tool.

```bash
# Run the following command to authenticate
gcloud auth login
```

This will open a browser window where you can log in to your Google Cloud account.

#### **Step 3: Set a Default Project**

Set your default project ID, which ensures that your GCP requests are associated with the right project.

```bash
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your actual Google Cloud project ID.

### **2. Installing Google Cloud Python Client Libraries**

To interact with GCP services programmatically, you'll need to install the appropriate Python client libraries.

Use `pip` to install the `google-cloud` package:

```bash
pip install google-cloud
```

For specific services, you can install additional packages, such as:

```bash
pip install google-cloud-storage  # For Cloud Storage
pip install google-cloud-compute  # For Compute Engine
```

---

### **3. Authenticating with Service Accounts**

While developing Python scripts to interact with GCP, it's best practice to use service accounts for authentication.

#### **Step 1: Create a Service Account**

In the GCP Console:
1. Navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.
2. Click **Create Service Account**.
3. Assign appropriate roles (e.g., "Storage Admin" for Cloud Storage, "Compute Admin" for Compute Engine).
4. Download the service account key in JSON format.

#### **Step 2: Set the Service Account Credentials**

To authenticate using the service account key:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your-service-account-key.json"
```

This environment variable tells the Google Cloud libraries to use the service account credentials for authentication.

### **4. Basic GCP Operations Using Python**

Once you've set up the environment and authenticated, you're ready to start interacting with GCP resources. Below are examples of how to interact with two core GCP services: **Cloud Storage** and **Compute Engine**.

#### **Creating and Managing Cloud Storage Buckets**

Cloud Storage allows you to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data. Here's an example of how to use Python to create a bucket.

##### **Example: Create a Bucket**

```python
from google.cloud import storage

def create_bucket(bucket_name):
    """Creates a new GCP bucket."""
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.create_bucket(bucket_name)
    print(f"Bucket {bucket.name} created.")

# Call the function with a bucket name
create_bucket("my-new-bucket")
```

##### **Example: Upload a File to Cloud Storage**

```python
from google.cloud import storage

def upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):
    """Uploads a file to the given GCP bucket."""
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
    blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)

    blob.upload_from_filename(source_file_name)
    print(f"File {source_file_name} uploaded to {destination_blob_name}.")

# Call the function with bucket name, source file, and destination blob name
upload_blob("my-new-bucket", "local-file.txt", "remote-file.txt")
```

#### **Interacting with Compute Engine**

You can automate the management of GCP Compute Engine instances using Python.

##### **Example: List All Instances in a Zone**

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def list_instances(project, zone):
    """Lists all instances in the specified project and zone."""
    instance_client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()
    instances = instance_client.list(project=project, zone=zone)
    for instance in instances:
        print(f"Instance: {instance.name}")

# Replace with your project ID and zone
list_instances("my-project-id", "us-central1-a")
```

##### **Example: Create a New VM Instance**

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def create_instance(project, zone, instance_name):
    """Creates a new virtual machine instance."""
    instance_client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()
    instance = compute_v1.Instance()
    instance.name = instance_name
    instance.machine_type = "zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1"
    instance.zone = zone

    # Specify the image and configuration for the instance here...

    operation = instance_client.insert(project=project, zone=zone, instance_resource=instance)
    print(f"VM instance {instance_name} creation started.")

# Replace with your project ID, zone, and desired instance name
create_instance("my-project-id", "us-central1-a", "my-new-instance")
```

### **Conclusion**

In this chapter, you've learned how to set up the environment to work with Python and GCP. You also explored basic interactions with GCP services like Cloud Storage and Compute Engine. With this foundation, you can expand your scripts to interact with other GCP services, automate tasks, and integrate GCP into your Python applications.
