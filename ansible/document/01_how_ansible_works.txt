# How Ansible Works

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that allows you to automate IT infrastructure tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and task execution.

Key Points:
1. Ansible uses a simple YAML-based language (Playbooks).
2. It communicates with remote machines over SSH.
3. It requires no agents on target machines, just SSH and Python.

For more details on Ansible architecture, refer to the official documentation: https://docs.ansible.com/
