# Ansible Overview

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies the automation of IT infrastructure tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and task execution. Itâ€™s powerful, agentless, and easy to use.

## Key Features of Ansible:
1. **Declarative Language**: Ansible uses a simple YAML-based language known as Playbooks to define tasks.
2. **Agentless**: Ansible communicates with remote machines over SSH and requires no agents or additional software on target machines, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.
3. **Extensibility**: With a rich library of modules, you can automate tasks for a wide range of applications and services.
