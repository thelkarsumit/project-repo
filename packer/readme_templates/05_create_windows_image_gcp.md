Here's the content for **`05_create_windows_image_gcp.json`**, which outlines how to use Packer to create a custom Windows image on Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

### `05_create_windows_image_gcp.json`
This template will create a custom Windows Server image on GCP. The process involves using the `googlecompute` builder to create an image based on a Windows server, and then using the `shell` provisioner to run any necessary configurations or installations.

### Breakdown of the Packer Template:

#### **Builders**:
1. **type**: The builder type is `googlecompute`, indicating that we are using GCP to create the image.
2. **project_id**: Replace `"your-gcp-project-id"` with your actual GCP project ID.
3. **zone**: Defines the GCP zone where the VM will be created, e.g., `"us-central1-a"`.
4. **source_image**: Specifies the source image from which the new image will be created. In this case, we use a Windows Server 2019 image.
5. **image_name**: The name of the image to be created. The `{{timestamp}}` placeholder adds a timestamp for unique naming.
6. **ssh_username**: Specifies the SSH username for the image.
7. **image_family**: Grouping images under a family helps organize them in GCP.
8. **machine_type**: Defines the type of VM (e.g., `n1-standard-1`).
9. **boot_disk_size**: Defines the size of the boot disk (e.g., `50` GB).
10. **disk_size**: Specifies the size of additional disks (e.g., `50` GB).
11. **tags**: Metadata tags associated with the VM, useful for filtering or networking.
12. **metadata**: Specifies a custom Windows startup script (`windows-startup-script.ps1`), which will be executed when the VM is initialized.

#### **Provisioners**:
1. **PowerShell Provisioner**:
   - Runs PowerShell commands inline to perform initial setup on the Windows VM.
   - Example commands:
     - `Set-Date` changes the system date.
     - `Install-WindowsFeature` installs the IIS web server.
     - `Set-ExecutionPolicy` sets the execution policy to allow running signed scripts.
   
2. **Shell Provisioner**:
   - The `shell` provisioner runs a script (`install-software.sh`) to install any additional software needed on the Windows server.
   - This script is specified by the `script` argument. You can create a `scripts/install-software.sh` file that installs required packages and tools.

#### **Windows Startup Script**:
The `metadata` field specifies a `windows-startup-script-ps1` that will be executed at startup. This PowerShell script can handle any additional configuration or software installation that needs to happen when the image starts. For example:

### `scripts/windows-startup-script.ps1`:
```powershell
# Example Windows startup script
Write-Host "Running Windows startup script"

# Set the time zone (e.g., UTC)
tzutil /s "UTC"

# Install Windows Updates
Install-WindowsUpdate -AcceptAll -AutoReboot

# Example: Install additional software or configuration
# Download and install the latest version of Chocolatey
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Set system settings or customize the image further as needed
```

### **Additional Notes**:
- **Authentication**: Make sure your Packer configuration has appropriate permissions for your GCP project (use a service account with the `compute.instanceAdmin` role).
- **Shell vs. PowerShell Provisioners**: While PowerShell is used for Windows-specific configurations, shell provisioners can still be used for running scripts that are compatible with the Windows environment (e.g., Bash scripts if WSL is available).
- **Scripts**: Ensure that any scripts you reference (like `install-software.sh` or `windows-startup-script.ps1`) exist in the appropriate `scripts/` directory and are executable by Packer.

This setup should create a customized Windows image on GCP with your specified configuration. If you need more advanced configurations, you can adjust the template to meet those needs! Let me know if you have any specific adjustments or further details you'd like to add.
