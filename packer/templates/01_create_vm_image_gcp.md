Here is the content for the Packer template `01_create_vm_image_gcp.json`, which will guide you through creating a custom VM image on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Packer.

### `01_create_vm_image_gcp.json`

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "googlecompute",
      "project_id": "your-project-id",  // GCP Project ID
      "source_image": "debian-9-stretch-v20190709",  // Source image (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS)
      "zone": "us-central1-a",  // GCP Zone
      "image_name": "packer-demo-{{timestamp}}",  // Image name pattern
      "ssh_username": "packer",  // SSH username for the VM
      "ssh_private_key_file": "./ssh_key",  // Path to SSH private key (ensure key permissions are set)
      "image_family": "packer-demo-family",  // Optional: Image family to associate with the image
      "tags": ["packer", "demo"],  // Optional: Tags for the created image
      "force_delete": true,  // Force image deletion if already exists
      "disk_size": 10,  // Optional: Disk size in GB for the image
      "disk_type": "pd-standard",  // Disk type (can be "pd-ssd" or "pd-standard")
      "tags": ["packer", "gcp"]
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "script": "./scripts/install-software.sh"  // Path to your provisioning script (e.g., install software or configure the system)
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Fields:

#### `builders` Section:
- **`type`**: Defines the builder type, in this case, `googlecompute` for creating a VM image on Google Cloud.
- **`project_id`**: Your GCP project ID where the VM image will be created. Replace `"your-project-id"` with your actual GCP project ID.
- **`source_image`**: The base image from which the VM will be built (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu). Ensure that the image is publicly available or is part of your project.
- **`zone`**: The GCP zone in which the VM will be created. Zones in GCP typically follow the format `region-a`, `region-b`, etc.
- **`image_name`**: The name pattern for the generated image. The `{{timestamp}}` variable will append the current timestamp to make the name unique.
- **`ssh_username`**: The SSH username for accessing the instance after it's created. You should make sure this user is valid in the base image.
- **`ssh_private_key_file`**: Path to the SSH private key to authenticate the builder with the GCP instance. Ensure the private key file is accessible and has the proper permissions.
- **`image_family`**: Optionally, specify the image family to associate the generated image with.
- **`tags`**: Tags to associate with the image, which can be useful for filtering or categorization in GCP.
- **`force_delete`**: When set to `true`, this will force the deletion of any existing image with the same name.
- **`disk_size`**: Size of the disk (in GB) for the VM image. You can modify this depending on your use case.
- **`disk_type`**: The type of persistent disk for the VM, which can be `pd-ssd` (solid-state) or `pd-standard` (HDD).

#### `provisioners` Section:
- **`type`**: In this case, `shell` to run a shell script on the VM during the build process.
- **`script`**: Path to the shell script that will be executed to install software, configure the system, or run any necessary provisioning tasks. The script could include commands like installing Apache, NGINX, or any other software you need on your image. Example script file: `./scripts/install-software.sh`.

### Example Provisioning Script (`install-software.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the system
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Apache
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y

# Enable Apache to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable apache2

# Start Apache service
sudo systemctl start apache2

# Optional: Install other software or configure the system
echo "Software installation complete."
```

### How to Use This Template:

1. **Authentication**: Make sure you have the proper credentials to authenticate Packer with Google Cloud.
   - Set the `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account JSON key file.
   - Example:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
   ```

2. **Run the Build**:
   - Once your template (`01_create_vm_image_gcp.json`) and provisioning script (`install-software.sh`) are ready, you can trigger the build using the following command:
   ```bash
   packer build 01_create_vm_image_gcp.json
   ```

3. **Output**: After successful execution, Packer will create a new VM image in your GCP project with the name pattern `packer-demo-<timestamp>`. This image can be used to launch instances in GCP.
