Here’s an example of how you can structure the content for the `03_create_vm_image_aws.json` chapter, which will explain the process of creating a custom VM image (AMI) in AWS using Packer.

### Chapter: **03_create_vm_image_aws.json**

#### Overview
In this chapter, we will learn how to create a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) using **Packer** for AWS. Packer simplifies the process of creating VM images that can be used to quickly launch instances in AWS with a predefined configuration.

#### Prerequisites
1. **AWS Account:** You should have an AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions (e.g., `AmazonEC2FullAccess`).
2. **Packer Installed:** Ensure that Packer is installed on your local machine or server.
3. **AWS CLI Configured:** AWS CLI should be configured with access keys, or you can use an IAM role if running from an EC2 instance.

#### Packer Template: **create_vm_image_aws.json**
Below is a Packer template that builds a custom AWS AMI based on an existing AMI (for example, Ubuntu 20.04). The process will include the creation of an instance, provisioning of software, and then creating the final image (AMI).

##### **Template Explanation**
1. **Builders**: Defines the source image and the instance configuration.
2. **Provisioners**: Specifies the steps to install software or make changes to the image.
3. **Post-processors (optional)**: Used to modify the image once it is created.

##### **AWS Packer Template Example**

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "aws_access_key": "{{env `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`}}",
    "aws_secret_key": "{{env `AWS_SECRET_KEY`}}",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "ami_name": "packer-demo-{{timestamp}}",
    "source_ami": "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0",  // Example Ubuntu 20.04 image ID
    "instance_type": "t2.micro",
    "ssh_username": "ubuntu"
  },
  
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "access_key": "{{user `aws_access_key`}}",
      "secret_key": "{{user `aws_secret_key`}}",
      "region": "{{user `region`}}",
      "source_ami": "{{user `source_ami`}}",
      "instance_type": "{{user `instance_type`}}",
      "ami_name": "{{user `ami_name`}}",
      "ami_description": "Custom AMI created with Packer",
      "ssh_username": "{{user `ssh_username`}}",
      "tags": {
        "Name": "packer-demo-image"
      },
      "ssh_interface": "public_ip",
      "ssh_keypair_name": "packer-key",  // Ensure to have this keypair in AWS
      "ssh_private_key_file": "~/.ssh/packer-key.pem",
      "run_tags": {
        "Name": "packer-builder-instance"
      }
    }
  ],
  
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "script": "./scripts/install-software.sh"  // Example script to install software
    }
  ],

  "post-processors": [
    {
      "type": "manifest",
      "output": "packer-manifest.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Sections in the Template:

#### 1. **Variables**
   - `aws_access_key` & `aws_secret_key`: These are environment variables for securely passing AWS credentials. You can replace these with your own hardcoded credentials (not recommended).
   - `region`: The AWS region where you want the instance to be launched and the AMI to be created.
   - `ami_name`: The name of the custom AMI that will be generated. The `{{timestamp}}` variable ensures a unique name is generated with each build.
   - `source_ami`: The base AMI ID you want to start with (e.g., an Ubuntu 20.04 AMI ID).
   - `instance_type`: The instance type for creating the VM (e.g., `t2.micro`).
   - `ssh_username`: The username for SSH access (in this case, `ubuntu` for Ubuntu-based AMIs).

#### 2. **Builders:**
   - **amazon-ebs**: Specifies the builder type for AWS. Here, we are using the `amazon-ebs` builder, which stands for Amazon Elastic Block Store, and it creates an image from an EBS-backed instance.
   - **access_key & secret_key**: Your AWS credentials used to authenticate Packer with AWS.
   - **source_ami**: This is the base AMI ID from which Packer will create the new AMI.
   - **ami_name**: The name of the generated AMI.
   - **ssh_username**: The SSH username used for accessing the instance (common values for different Linux AMIs are `ubuntu`, `ec2-user`, or `centos`).
   - **ssh_interface**: Specifies whether Packer will use the public or private IP to connect to the instance.
   - **ssh_keypair_name**: The AWS keypair name you’ll use for SSH access.
   - **run_tags**: Tags that you apply to the instance running the build.

#### 3. **Provisioners:**
   - **shell**: This provisioner will run a shell script inside the instance. In this case, the script (`install-software.sh`) installs additional software on the instance before it is turned into an AMI.
   - You can replace this script with your own, such as installing web servers or configuring security settings.

#### 4. **Post-processors (optional):**
   - **manifest**: After the AMI is created, a manifest file (`packer-manifest.json`) is generated. This file contains information about the build process and can be used for future reference or automation.

### Example Shell Script for Provisioning (install-software.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script will install a simple web server and custom software

# Update the system
sudo apt-get update -y

# Install Apache
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y

# Install additional packages if needed
sudo apt-get install curl git -y

# Start the Apache service
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

### How to Run the Build

1. **Ensure your AWS credentials are configured properly.** You can set them via environment variables or use the AWS CLI to authenticate.
   
2. **Create a Packer build:**
   ```bash
   packer build create_vm_image_aws.json
   ```

3. **Monitor the build process.** Packer will initiate an instance on AWS, run the provisioning steps (e.g., installing Apache), and then create an AMI once the provisioning steps are completed.

4. **Use the resulting AMI**: After the build completes, the new AMI will appear in the AWS EC2 console under AMIs. You can now use it to launch new EC2 instances.

### Conclusion
In this chapter, we successfully created a custom AMI in AWS using Packer. We used a simple template with an `amazon-ebs` builder to launch an EC2 instance, install software, and create an AMI. This template can be extended with additional provisioning steps or post-processors to suit your needs.
