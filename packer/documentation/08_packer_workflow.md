# 08. Packer Workflow

## Introduction to the Packer Workflow

The Packer workflow is a sequence of steps that you follow to create machine images across multiple platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure). The workflow involves creating a Packer template, validating the template, building the image, and post-processing the image (if necessary). 

A typical Packer workflow consists of the following steps:
1. **Write a Template**: Define the image configuration in a Packer template (JSON or HCL).
2. **Validate the Template**: Run a validation command to ensure the template is correct.
3. **Build the Image**: Use the `packer build` command to create the image based on the template.
4. **Post-processing (optional)**: After the image is created, you can use post-processors to modify or distribute the image (e.g., upload to a storage bucket, push to a marketplace).

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Write a Packer Template

A Packer template is a configuration file that specifies how to build an image. It defines the `builders`, `provisioners`, and `post-processors`.

- **Builders**: Define the platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and the base image for building the machine image.
- **Provisioners**: Specify the software to be installed on the machine image.
- **Post-processors**: Apply additional steps after the image is created, such as uploading it to a cloud storage service or marketplace.

#### Example Template Structure
```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "googlecompute",
      "project_id": "your-gcp-project-id",
      "source_image": "debian-9-stretch-v20190709",
      "zone": "us-central1-a",
      "image_name": "packer-demo-{{timestamp}}",
      "ssh_username": "packer"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "script": "./scripts/install-software.sh"
    }
  ],
  "post-processors": [
    {
      "type": "manifest",
      "output": "manifest.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Validate the Template

Once you have written your template, it's essential to validate it. This step checks if the template is syntactically correct and if all variables are properly defined.

#### Command:
```bash
packer validate template.json
```
- **What it does**: This command ensures that the syntax is correct and the template can be executed.
- **Outcome**: If the validation passes, you can proceed to the build phase. If it fails, Packer will provide error messages to help you correct the issues.

### 3. Build the Image

Once validated, the next step is to build the image. The `packer build` command reads the template file and creates the image according to the configurations defined in the template.

#### Command:
```bash
packer build template.json
```
- **What it does**: Packer reads the template, interacts with the cloud provider (GCP, AWS, Azure, etc.), and creates a machine image.
- **Workflow details**: 
   - Packer first initializes the environment by launching a temporary virtual machine (VM).
   - It then runs the provisioning steps (such as installing software, configuring settings, etc.).
   - Once provisioning is complete, Packer creates an image based on the VM's state.
   - Packer will generate a final image (e.g., AMI, GCP image, etc.), which can be used to spin up new virtual machines with the same configuration.

#### Example Output:
```bash
==> googlecompute: Creating temporary SSH key for instance...
==> googlecompute: Starting instance...
==> googlecompute: Waiting for instance to become available...
==> googlecompute: Provisioning with shell script: ./scripts/install-software.sh
==> googlecompute: Creating image...
==> googlecompute: Image created successfully: packer-demo-1617812345
```

### 4. Post-processing (Optional)

After the image is created, you can apply **post-processors** to perform additional steps. For example, you might upload the image to a cloud storage bucket, send it to a repository, or generate metadata.

#### Example Post-Processor Configuration:
```json
"post-processors": [
  {
    "type": "googlecompute",
    "destination_image": "gs://your-bucket/packer-image/{{timestamp}}.tar"
  }
]
```

### 5. Debugging and Logging

During the workflow, it's common to run into issues or need detailed logs for troubleshooting. Packer provides several ways to debug builds:

#### Verbose Logging:
```bash
PACKER_LOG=1 packer build template.json
```
This will enable detailed logging, which can help diagnose issues.

#### Debug Mode:
For debugging, you can run Packer in interactive mode by using the `-debug` flag:
```bash
packer build -debug template.json
```
This allows you to pause the build at each step and interact with the running process.

### 6. Clean-up

After building the image, it's important to clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs (especially with cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure).

- **Delete temporary instances**: Ensure that the temporary VM instances created during the build are destroyed after the image is created.
- **Remove local caches or files**: If using post-processors, ensure that no leftover files remain on your local machine.

### 7. Integrating Packer with CI/CD

Packer can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the image creation process. Here’s an example of how to trigger Packer builds using Jenkins or GitLab CI.

#### Example Jenkins Pipeline:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Validate') {
            steps {
                sh 'packer validate template.json'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'packer build template.json'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Example GitLab CI:
```yaml
stages:
  - validate
  - build

validate:
  script:
    - packer validate template.json

build:
  script:
    - packer build template.json
```

### 8. Versioning and Template Management

To maintain a clean workflow and avoid confusion, it's a good practice to version your Packer templates, especially if you're working on multiple projects or collaborating with teams.

#### Using Git for Version Control:
- Store your templates in a version-controlled repository.
- Use Git tags and branches to manage different versions of your templates.
  
For example, you might tag your templates with versions like `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc., to track changes and ensure consistency.

## Conclusion

The Packer workflow is simple yet powerful. It allows you to automate the creation of machine images across multiple platforms, making it easier to scale, maintain, and deploy your infrastructure. By following the workflow steps—writing templates, validating, building, and post-processing—you can ensure that your images are consistently built and ready for use. Integrating Packer into your CI/CD pipeline further enhances automation and efficiency in your infrastructure-as-code practices.
