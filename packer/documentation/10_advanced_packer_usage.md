## 1. Custom Provisioning with Shell and Scripts

Packer allows you to provision your VM images using simple shell scripts. This provides a way to automate the installation of software or perform any system configuration. You can use a shell script as a provisioner in your Packer template.

Example:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "googlecompute",
      "project_id": "your-project-id",
      "source_image": "debian-9-stretch-v20190709",
      "zone": "us-central1-a",
      "image_name": "custom-image-{{timestamp}}",
      "ssh_username": "packer"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "script": "scripts/install_dependencies.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the `install_dependencies.sh` script can install packages or make other changes required for the VM image. Packer will execute the script as part of the provisioning process.

---

## 2. Using Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for Provisioning

In addition to shell scripts, Packer also supports provisioning using more sophisticated configuration management tools like **Ansible**, **Chef**, or **Puppet**. This enables you to leverage your existing automation frameworks to configure images.

### Example of Using Ansible with Packer:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "googlecompute",
      "project_id": "your-project-id",
      "source_image": "ubuntu-1804-bionic-v20210101",
      "zone": "us-central1-a",
      "image_name": "packer-ansible-image-{{timestamp}}",
      "ssh_username": "packer"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "ansible",
      "playbook_file": "ansible/playbook.yml"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this setup, Packer will run the Ansible playbook (`playbook.yml`) to configure the VM image with the required packages and configurations. You can also use Chef or Puppet in a similar manner, by configuring the appropriate provisioner type.

---

## 3. Advanced Post-Processors

Post-processors allow you to perform actions after the image has been created. These actions could include compressing the image, uploading it to a different storage location, or applying further transformations.

### Example: Compressing the Image and Uploading to S3

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "ami_name": "custom-ami-{{timestamp}}",
      "source_ami": "ami-0d5d9d301c853a04a",
      "instance_type": "t2.micro",
      "region": "us-east-1"
    }
  ],
  "post-processors": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-s3",
      "bucket": "packer-images",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "acl": "private"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, once the AMI is created, the **Amazon S3 post-processor** uploads the image to a specific S3 bucket. Post-processors can automate other tasks like image conversion, deployment, or syncing across regions.

---

## 4. Multi-Platform Builds

Packer is capable of creating images for multiple platforms in a single build process. This is especially useful when you're targeting several cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) or creating images for different operating systems (Linux, Windows).

### Example: Multi-Platform Template

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "ami_name": "ubuntu-{{timestamp}}",
      "source_ami": "ami-0d5d9d301c853a04a",
      "instance_type": "t2.micro",
      "region": "us-east-1"
    },
    {
      "type": "googlecompute",
      "project_id": "your-project-id",
      "source_image": "debian-9-stretch-v20190709",
      "zone": "us-central1-a",
      "image_name": "ubuntu-{{timestamp}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

This example creates an AMI for AWS and a VM image for GCP. Packer will sequentially create both images during the same build process.

---

## 5. Building Custom Images with Additional Software

Customizing your images to include specific software, security patches, or configuration settings is one of Packer’s core strengths. You can either use shell scripts or tools like Ansible for this.

### Example: Installing a Web Server

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "googlecompute",
      "project_id": "your-project-id",
      "source_image": "ubuntu-1804-bionic-v20210101",
      "zone": "us-central1-a",
      "image_name": "custom-webserver-{{timestamp}}"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": [
        "sudo apt-get update",
        "sudo apt-get install -y apache2"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, Packer creates a VM image with Apache installed, ready to serve web content.

---

## 6. Conditional Logic in Packer Templates

Packer allows conditional logic in templates using the `only` and `except` fields in the builders. This enables you to control which builders run under specific circumstances.

### Example: Using `only` and `except`

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "ami_name": "web-server-{{timestamp}}",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "only": ["amazon"]
    },
    {
      "type": "googlecompute",
      "project_id": "your-project-id",
      "source_image": "ubuntu-1804-bionic-v20210101",
      "zone": "us-central1-a",
      "only": ["google"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Here, the AWS builder will only execute when the `amazon` platform is selected, and the GCP builder will only execute when the `google` platform is selected.

---

## 7. Using Packer with CI/CD Pipelines

Integrating Packer into a CI/CD pipeline allows you to automate the creation and updating of VM images as part of your software deployment pipeline.

### Example: Integrating Packer with Jenkins

1. Create a Jenkins pipeline that triggers a Packer build.
2. Use Jenkins to manage authentication and trigger Packer builds on push to a GitHub repository.

In Jenkins, you can use the **Packer Build Step Plugin** or run Packer commands directly in a build script to trigger your image creation process.

---

## 8. Managing Secrets and Credentials

Storing secrets like cloud provider credentials securely is essential. You should never hardcode credentials in your Packer templates. Instead, use environment variables or external secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

### Example: Using Environment Variables for Credentials

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "access_key": "{{env `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`}}",
      "secret_key": "{{env `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`}}",
      "ami_name": "custom-ami-{{timestamp}}",
      "region": "us-east-1"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, Packer retrieves AWS credentials from environment variables instead of storing them directly in the template.

---

## 9. Versioning and Managing Templates

As your infrastructure evolves, it’s important to version control your Packer templates and keep track of changes. Git is an excellent tool for versioning templates, and you can also tag releases to mark significant milestones in your image-building process.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting Advanced Builds

Advanced Packer builds often involve multiple steps and complex integrations. Here are some tips for troubleshooting:

- **Check Logs**: Use `packer build -debug` to get more detailed logs during the build process.
- **Test Each Step**: Break down your template into smaller parts and test each builder, provisioner, or post-processor individually.
- **Error Handling**: Understand common errors like timeout issues, network problems, or incorrect configurations. Packer’s error messages and logs provide helpful context for resolving these issues.

This concludes the advanced Packer usage chapter. By mastering these advanced features, you can leverage Packer to automate complex image-building workflows and integrate it into a robust CI/CD pipeline.
