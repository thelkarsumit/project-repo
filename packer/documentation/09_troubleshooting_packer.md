# 09: Troubleshooting Packer

When using Packer to automate the creation of machine images, you might encounter various issues related to configuration, cloud provider integration, or network problems. In this chapter, we will cover common Packer errors and how to resolve them.

## 1. **General Troubleshooting Tips**

Before diving into specific errors, consider these general troubleshooting steps:
- **Check the logs:** Packer provides detailed logs of each build process. Run the build command with the `-debug` flag to get more detailed output:

   ```bash
   packer build -debug your-template.json
   ```

- **Ensure cloud credentials are correct:** Make sure your credentials (API keys, service accounts, etc.) are properly configured. If you are working with GCP, AWS, or Azure, verify that you have the correct permissions for the build process.
  
- **Check the internet connection:** Packer requires an internet connection to download images, install software, or connect to cloud APIs. Ensure your system has an active internet connection.

- **Use `packer validate`:** Before running the build, use the `packer validate` command to check your template for syntax errors.

   ```bash
   packer validate your-template.json
   ```

## 2. **Common Packer Errors and Solutions**

### 2.1 **Error: `Authentication failed`**

#### Issue:
Packer may fail to authenticate with the cloud provider (e.g., GCP, AWS, or Azure). This is typically caused by missing or incorrect credentials.

#### Solution:
- **For GCP:** Ensure that your service account has the appropriate permissions. Set up authentication by exporting your `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable with the path to your service account JSON key file.

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your-service-account-file.json"
   ```

- **For AWS:** Make sure that your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables are set correctly. You can also use the AWS CLI to verify your credentials:

   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```

- **For Azure:** Use `az login` to authenticate to Azure and ensure that your Packer template is using the correct subscription.

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

### 2.2 **Error: `No source image found`**

#### Issue:
Packer cannot find the source image for building the VM. This error is typically caused by an incorrect image reference in your template or a missing image in your cloud provider.

#### Solution:
- **GCP:** Ensure that the image name or family exists in your project, and the correct region or zone is specified. Use the GCP Console or the `gcloud` CLI to verify the image.

   ```bash
   gcloud compute images list
   ```

- **AWS:** Ensure that the `source_ami` ID is valid and exists in the specified region. Use the AWS Console or AWS CLI to verify the image ID.

   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids ami-xxxxxxxx
   ```

- **Azure:** Check if the `source_image` exists in your Azure subscription by using the Azure portal or `az vm image list` command.

   ```bash
   az vm image list --publisher Canonical --offer UbuntuServer --all --out table
   ```

### 2.3 **Error: `Error starting the VM`**

#### Issue:
This error occurs when Packer tries to start a VM using a builder but encounters an issue like incorrect VM configurations or misconfigured network settings.

#### Solution:
- **Check the VM configuration:** Make sure the `ssh_username` is correctly configured in your template and that the VM image supports SSH access.
- **Verify network and firewall settings:** Ensure that any required firewall ports (e.g., SSH port 22) are open, and the VM is accessible from the machine where you're running Packer.
- **Check for quota limits:** Some cloud providers may impose limits on the number of instances, IP addresses, or resources in your account. Ensure that you're within your quota limits.

### 2.4 **Error: `Provisioning script failed`**

#### Issue:
The provisioning script that you specified in the Packer template fails during execution. This could be caused by a syntax error, missing dependencies, or incorrect paths.

#### Solution:
- **Review the provisioning script:** Check the script for errors, missing dependencies, or incorrect paths. If using shell scripts, ensure that they are executable and that the environment in the template matches the scriptâ€™s requirements.
- **Check for sudo permissions:** If the script requires elevated privileges, make sure the user running the script has the necessary `sudo` privileges.

   Example of adding passwordless sudo in a Packer template:

   ```json
   "provisioners": [
     {
       "type": "shell",
       "inline": ["echo 'packer ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers"]
     }
   ]
   ```

- **Enable debug output for provisioning:** Use the `-debug` flag to print detailed output from provisioning scripts:

   ```bash
   packer build -debug your-template.json
   ```

### 2.5 **Error: `Failed to upload artifact`**

#### Issue:
This error typically occurs when Packer fails to upload the built image or artifact to the cloud provider's storage.

#### Solution:
- **Check storage permissions:** Ensure that your cloud credentials have the necessary permissions to write to the cloud storage (e.g., GCP Cloud Storage, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
- **Check storage availability:** Ensure that the target storage bucket or container exists and is accessible.

### 2.6 **Error: `Timeout waiting for SSH`**

#### Issue:
This error occurs when Packer tries to SSH into the VM but doesn't get a response within the configured timeout period.

#### Solution:
- **Check VM status:** Verify that the VM has started correctly and is accessible.
- **Increase SSH timeout:** If the VM takes longer to start, increase the SSH timeout in your Packer template. For example, in the GCP builder, add:

   ```json
   "ssh_timeout": "10m"
   ```

- **Check SSH configuration:** Ensure that the correct SSH username and private key are specified in your template. Also, verify that the VM is configured to allow SSH access.

### 2.7 **Error: `Invalid JSON syntax`**

#### Issue:
The template file contains syntax errors, such as missing commas, extra brackets, or incorrect key-value pairs.

#### Solution:
- **Validate the template:** Use `packer validate` to check the syntax of your JSON template:

   ```bash
   packer validate your-template.json
   ```

- **Check JSON formatting:** Use an online JSON validator or a code editor with syntax highlighting to ensure the file is correctly formatted.

## 3. **Debugging Packer Builds**

### 3.1 **Enable Detailed Logging**

Use the `-debug` flag to get a detailed log of your Packer run. It will show you what Packer is doing at each step, including builder actions, provisioning scripts, and errors.

```bash
packer build -debug your-template.json
```

### 3.2 **Increase Log Level**

You can also increase the log verbosity by setting the `PACKER_LOG` environment variable. The higher the level, the more verbose the logs:

```bash
export PACKER_LOG=1   # Set log level to 1 (basic info)
export PACKER_LOG=2   # Set log level to 2 (verbose)
```

Logs will be written to `packer.log`.

## 4. **Conclusion**

Troubleshooting Packer builds requires patience and a systematic approach. Always start by checking the logs, validating your template, and ensuring correct credentials. Use the `-debug` flag for more insight into the build process, and don't hesitate to consult cloud provider documentation or the Packer community if you're stuck. Following these best practices should help resolve most common issues you encounter during your Packer builds.
