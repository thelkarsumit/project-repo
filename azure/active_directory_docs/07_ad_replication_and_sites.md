# AD Replication and Sites

## Overview
Active Directory (AD) replication ensures that directory data is consistent across all domain controllers (DCs) in an AD forest. It allows changes made on one DC to propagate to others, maintaining a unified directory service. This chapter explores the key concepts, components, and configuration of replication and sites in AD.

## 1. What is AD Replication?

### **Definition**
AD replication is the process of synchronizing changes made in one domain controller (DC) to all other DCs within the forest. It ensures that objects like users, groups, and GPOs are consistently available across the network.

### **Types of Replication**
1. **Intra-Site Replication**:
   - Occurs between DCs within the same site.
   - Fast and frequent replication.
   - Uses Remote Procedure Call (RPC) over IP.

2. **Inter-Site Replication**:
   - Occurs between DCs in different sites.
   - Designed for low bandwidth networks.
   - Uses RPC over IP or SMTP (less common).

## 2. How AD Replication Works

### **Key Concepts**
- **Multi-Master Replication**: 
  Changes can be made on any writable DC and are replicated to others.
  
- **Update Sequence Numbers (USN)**: 
  Each change is assigned a unique USN to track updates.

- **Conflict Resolution**:
  If conflicting changes are detected, the **Last Writer Wins** principle applies, based on the timestamp of the changes.

## 3. AD Sites and Subnets

### **What is a Site?**
An AD site represents a physical network location, typically a LAN or data center, where DCs are connected by high-speed networks. Sites are used to optimize replication and client logon traffic.

### **Subnets in AD**
- Subnets define the IP address ranges associated with sites.
- Ensures that client computers are directed to the nearest DC for authentication.

## 4. Replication Topology

### **How Topology is Built**
The **Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC)** automatically generates and manages the replication topology.

### **Key Components**
1. **Connection Objects**: Define replication paths between DCs.
2. **Bridgehead Servers**: Handle inter-site replication.
3. **Site Link Bridges**: Enable communication between non-adjacent sites.

## 5. Configuring AD Replication

### **Steps to Configure Sites and Subnets**
1. Open **Active Directory Sites and Services**.
2. Create a new site:
   - Right-click **Sites**, select **New Site**.
   - Assign a site link to the new site.
3. Define subnets:
   - Right-click **Subnets**, select **New Subnet**.
   - Associate the subnet with a site.

### **Configuring Replication Costs and Intervals**
- Adjust site link costs to prioritize certain replication paths.
- Set replication intervals to control the frequency of inter-site replication.

## 6. Monitoring and Troubleshooting AD Replication

### **Tools for Monitoring**
1. **Repadmin**: Command-line tool to monitor replication status.
   - Example: `repadmin /replsummary`
2. **DCDiag**: Diagnostic tool for DC health.
   - Example: `dcdiag /test:replications`
3. **Event Viewer**: Check the Directory Service logs for replication errors.

### **Common Replication Issues**
1. **Stale Data**:
   - Occurs when replication is delayed.
   - Fix: Force replication using `repadmin /syncall`.
   
2. **Misconfigured Sites/Subnets**:
   - Ensure subnets are properly associated with sites.

3. **Replication Failures**:
   - Check network connectivity between DCs.
   - Use `repadmin /showrepl` to identify problem areas.

## 7. Best Practices for AD Replication
1. Use high-speed links for intra-site replication.
2. Configure site links with appropriate costs to reflect physical network topology.
3. Regularly monitor replication using tools like **Repadmin** and **Event Viewer**.
4. Avoid excessive replication by optimizing site design and schedules.

## Conclusion
Active Directory replication and sites are essential for maintaining a consistent and efficient directory service. Properly configuring and monitoring replication ensures that data is synchronized across all domain controllers, enhancing the reliability and performance of your AD environment.
