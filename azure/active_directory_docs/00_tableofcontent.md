# Is Anything Missing?

While this structure is comprehensive, there are a few niche or rare tasks that could be added if needed, depending on your goals or environment:

1. **Federation Services (ADFS)**  
   Learn about setting up and managing **Active Directory Federation Services** (used for Single Sign-On across applications).

2. **Certificate Services (AD CS)**  
   Manage **Active Directory Certificate Services**, which handle public key infrastructure (PKI) in an AD environment.

3. **Advanced PowerShell Automation**  
   Dive deeper into custom PowerShell scripts for advanced scenarios like mass user creation, bulk updates, or dynamic group management.

4. **Performance Optimization**  
   Techniques for tuning AD performance in large-scale deployments.
