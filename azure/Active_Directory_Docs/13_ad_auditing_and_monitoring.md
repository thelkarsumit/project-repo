# Chapter 13: Auditing and Monitoring in Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) auditing and monitoring are essential for maintaining the security and integrity of your AD environment. This chapter will guide you through the process of setting up auditing policies, configuring monitoring solutions, and using built-in tools to keep track of changes and performance in your AD infrastructure.

## 13.1: Overview of Auditing and Monitoring in AD

Auditing and monitoring are critical aspects of AD management that help ensure:
- **Security Compliance**: Track changes and access to sensitive data.
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify and resolve issues with user authentication, group membership, and object changes.
- **Performance Management**: Monitor the health and performance of domain controllers and replication.

## 13.2: Configuring AD Auditing Policies

Auditing in AD helps track changes to objects, permissions, logon attempts, and other critical activities. To configure auditing in AD:

### 13.2.1: Enabling Audit Policy via Group Policy
1. Open the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** on a domain controller.
2. Navigate to `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Account Logon`.
3. Enable the following categories:
   - **Logon/Logoff**: Tracks user logon and logoff events.
   - **Account Management**: Monitors changes to user accounts and groups.
   - **Directory Service Access**: Monitors AD object modifications.
   - **Logon/Logoff Events**: Tracks when a user logs into or logs off from a system.

```plaintext
Audit Policy Example:
- Audit Logon/Logoff Success/Failure
- Audit Account Logon Events Success/Failure
- Audit Directory Service Access Success/Failure
```

### 13.2.2: Configuring Object-Level Auditing
1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**.
2. Right-click on an AD object (user, group, OU) and select **Properties**.
3. Go to the **Security** tab and click **Advanced**.
4. Under the **Auditing** tab, add the users/groups you want to audit and define the actions to be logged (e.g., read, modify, delete).

### 13.2.3: Review Audit Logs in Event Viewer
1. Go to **Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Security** to view security logs.
2. Look for event IDs like:
   - **Event ID 4720**: User account created.
   - **Event ID 4726**: User account deleted.
   - **Event ID 5136**: A directory object was modified.

## 13.3: Setting Up Active Directory Monitoring

### 13.3.1: Monitoring Domain Controllers (DCs)
Domain controllers are the backbone of AD. Monitoring their health is vital for ensuring availability and performance.

#### Tools for DC Monitoring:
- **Windows Performance Monitor (PerfMon)**: Used to monitor system performance, including AD-related counters like `NTDS` (Directory Services) and `LDAP`.
- **Event Viewer**: Use Event Viewer to check system logs, including AD-related events under the **Directory Services** log.
- **Active Directory Diagnostics Tools**: Use `dcdiag` for in-depth diagnostics of domain controller health.

```bash
dcdiag /v /c /d /e /s:DomainControllerName
```

This command runs a full diagnostic check on the specified domain controller.

### 13.3.2: Configuring Alerts for AD Health
You can configure alerts for various AD health parameters such as replication issues, DNS problems, and performance degradation.

#### Setting up Alerts in PerfMon:
1. Open **PerfMon** and go to `Data Collector Sets > User Defined`.
2. Right-click and select **New > Data Collector Set**.
3. Choose **Create manually (Advanced)** and configure the counters to monitor AD performance metrics.
4. Set thresholds and choose the type of alert (email, SNMP trap).

## 13.4: Common Monitoring Tasks and Alerts

### 13.4.1: Monitoring Replication
Active Directory replication ensures that changes made to one domain controller are replicated to others. Monitoring replication is crucial to detect failures early.

#### Tools for Replication Monitoring:
- **Repadmin**: A powerful tool for monitoring AD replication status.
- Command to check replication status:
```bash
repadmin /replsummary
```

This command provides a summary of replication health and any potential issues.

### 13.4.2: Monitoring Logon Attempts
Tracking successful and failed logon attempts can help identify potential security risks.

#### Setting up Logon Alerts:
1. In the **Group Policy** settings, enable auditing for **Logon/Logoff Events**.
2. Configure **Event Viewer** to capture failed logins.
3. Set up alerts to notify you whenever there is a high volume of failed logon attempts (indicating a brute force attack).

### 13.4.3: Monitoring Group Membership Changes
Changes to group memberships are critical for security. Monitoring these changes ensures that only authorized users are part of sensitive groups.

#### Alert for Group Membership Changes:
1. Enable auditing for **Account Management** events.
2. Look for **Event ID 4728** (added to a group) and **Event ID 4729** (removed from a group).
3. Set up email notifications or use a monitoring tool to alert you when these events occur.

## 13.5: Troubleshooting Monitoring Issues

### 13.5.1: Troubleshooting Replication Problems
Use the following steps to troubleshoot replication issues:
1. Check replication status with **Repadmin**.
2. Review the **Event Viewer** logs for error messages related to replication.
3. Run **dcdiag** to perform a comprehensive diagnostic check.

### 13.5.2: Troubleshooting Failed Logon Attempts
For failed logon attempts:
1. Review **Event ID 529** (logon failure) in Event Viewer.
2. Check for possible causes such as incorrect credentials, account lockouts, or expired passwords.

### 13.5.3: Resolving Group Policy Issues
If Group Policy changes are not being applied:
1. Check the **Group Policy Results** using `gpresult` command.
2. Ensure that GPOs are correctly linked to the appropriate organizational units (OUs).
3. Use **gpupdate /force** to refresh the policies.

## 13.6: Conclusion

Active Directory auditing and monitoring are critical for maintaining security, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring the health of the AD environment. With proper configuration, you can quickly detect potential problems and respond before they impact users or services. 

Regular auditing and monitoring practices will help ensure that your AD infrastructure is secure, compliant, and running efficiently.
