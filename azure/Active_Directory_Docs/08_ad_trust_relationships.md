# AD Trust Relationships  

## **Introduction**  
In large organizations or multi-domain/forest environments, **trust relationships** are crucial for enabling secure and seamless resource sharing between different Active Directory domains or forests. Trusts allow users in one domain to access resources in another domain without requiring separate accounts in both domains.

## **Key Concepts of Trust Relationships**  

### **What is a Trust?**  
A trust is a relationship established between two domains or forests that allows for authentication and access to resources. Trusts define the direction and scope of access.  

### **Trust Directions**  
1. **One-Way Trust**:  
   - Access flows in one direction only.  
   - Example: Domain A trusts Domain B, but Domain B doesn’t trust Domain A.  

2. **Two-Way Trust**:  
   - Access flows in both directions.  
   - Example: Both Domain A and Domain B trust each other.  

### **Types of Trusts**  
1. **Parent-Child Trust** (Automatic):  
   - Created when a new child domain is added to a parent domain.  
   - Always two-way and transitive.  

2. **Tree-Root Trust** (Automatic):  
   - Created between two root domains in a single forest.  
   - Always two-way and transitive.  

3. **External Trust** (Manual):  
   - Used to create a trust between domains in different forests (no forest trust).  
   - One-way or two-way, non-transitive.  

4. **Forest Trust** (Manual):  
   - Created between two forests to share resources.  
   - One-way or two-way, transitive.  

5. **Shortcut Trust** (Manual):  
   - Reduces authentication time in large forests by bypassing the hierarchy.  
   - One-way or two-way, transitive.  

6. **Realm Trust** (Manual):  
   - Connects an AD domain with a non-Windows Kerberos realm.  
   - One-way or two-way, transitive or non-transitive.

## **When to Use Trusts**  
- **Mergers and Acquisitions**: To integrate two separate AD environments.  
- **Resource Sharing**: When users from different domains or forests need to access shared resources.  
- **Cross-Platform Authentication**: Connecting AD with non-Windows systems using Realm Trust.

## **Configuring Trust Relationships**  

### **Pre-requisites**  
1. Ensure proper DNS name resolution between the domains or forests.  
2. Verify administrative permissions in both domains/forests.  
3. Check network connectivity (firewalls and ports like TCP 135, 389, 445, etc.).  

### **Steps to Create a Trust Relationship**  
1. **Open Active Directory Domains and Trusts**:  
   - Go to **Start → Administrative Tools → Active Directory Domains and Trusts**.  

2. **Right-Click the Domain**:  
   - Right-click the domain you want to create the trust for and select **Properties**.  

3. **Go to the Trusts Tab**:  
   - Navigate to the **Trusts** tab and click **New Trust**.  

4. **Follow the Wizard**:  
   - Select the type of trust (e.g., external, forest).  
   - Specify the direction of the trust (one-way or two-way).  
   - Enter the DNS name of the other domain/forest.  

5. **Authenticate**:  
   - Provide administrative credentials for both domains.  

6. **Validate the Trust**:  
   - Use the **Validate** button to ensure the trust is operational.

## **Validating and Managing Trusts**  

### **Tools for Validating Trusts**  
- **Active Directory Domains and Trusts**: Validate trusts from the GUI.  
- **Command-Line Tools**:  
  - `netdom trust`  
  - Example:  
    ```bash
    netdom trust <TrustingDomainName> /d:<TrustedDomainName> /verify
    ```  

### **Viewing Existing Trusts**  
- Use **Active Directory Domains and Trusts** to view all existing trusts.  

### **Editing or Deleting Trusts**  
- Trusts can be edited or removed via the **Trusts** tab in domain properties.

## **Troubleshooting Trust Issues**  

### **Common Issues**  
1. **DNS Resolution Errors**:  
   - Ensure proper DNS configuration for name resolution.  

2. **Authentication Failures**:  
   - Verify the trust type and direction.  
   - Check for time synchronization issues (Kerberos requires clocks to be within 5 minutes).  

3. **Firewall Restrictions**:  
   - Open required ports like TCP 135, 389, 445, and UDP 53.  

### **Using Diagnostic Tools**  
1. **DCDiag**:  
   - Checks the health of domain controllers and trusts.  
   - Example:  
     ```bash
     dcdiag /test:trusts
     ```  

2. **Event Viewer**:  
   - Look for errors in the **Security** and **System** logs.  

3. **Repadmin**:  
   - Validates replication and helps identify trust-related replication issues.

## **Best Practices for Trust Relationships**  
1. **Use Forest Trusts for Large Organizations**:  
   - Simplifies administration compared to multiple external trusts.  

2. **Secure Trust Relationships**:  
   - Limit the scope of trusts to only required resources.  

3. **Regular Validation**:  
   - Periodically validate trusts to ensure smooth operation.  

4. **Monitor Trust Traffic**:  
   - Use tools like **Wireshark** or **Event Viewer** to monitor authentication requests.  

5. **Document All Trusts**:  
   - Maintain a clear record of all trust relationships for troubleshooting and audits.

## **Summary**  
Trust relationships are vital for resource sharing across different domains and forests. Understanding the types of trusts, their configurations, and troubleshooting common issues ensures seamless and secure operations in multi-domain environments. With proper planning, trust relationships can greatly enhance the flexibility and scalability of Active Directory deployments.
