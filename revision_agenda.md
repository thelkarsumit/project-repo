### **Revision Plan (5 Days)**

#### **Day 1: Cloud Infrastructure with GCP and Terraform**
- **1. Google Cloud Platform Overview & Storage:**
  - Revise Google Cloud Storage concepts, including **manual creation** and using **Terraform modules** for storage resources (e.g., buckets, object lifecycle management).
  - Understand the **permissions** required for interacting with GCS via Terraform.
  - Revisit **SQL integration** with GCP (using Cloud SQL), including Terraform provisioning.

- **2. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**
  - Refresh your understanding of **VPC architecture**.
  - Review how to create **VPC** and **subnets** using **Terraform**, with emphasis on the usage of **map/list-variable** and dynamic resource creation.
  - Understand **firewall rules** for controlling traffic (e.g., SSH, IAP, HTTPS) and how these apply to your **Private VMs**.
  - Hands-on: Create a **private VM** and access it through **CLI and IAP** (with **NAT** and **firewall rules** applied).

#### **Day 2: Networking, Security, and Resource Management**
- **1. Networking:**
  - Review the fundamentals of **networking in GCP** (e.g., VPC, subnets, and routing).
  - Deep dive into **MIG (Managed Instance Groups)** and **UMIG** (Unmanaged Instance Groups), understanding their use cases in high availability and auto-scaling.

- **2. Terraform for Resource Management:**
  - Refresh your knowledge of using **Terraform modules** for creating **MIGs** and **load balancers**.
  - Explore **module reuse** for creating multiple resources with a single command, making your infrastructure more scalable.
  - Hands-on: Automate the creation of **MIG** and **load balancers** using **Terraform**.
  - Revise **state management** in Terraform (e.g., storing Terraform state in remote backends like GCS).

- **3. Security and IAM:**
  - Revise how to secure your infrastructure using **IAM roles and policies** for managing access control in GCP.
  - Revisit **NAT Gateway** configuration to allow private VMs to access the internet securely.

#### **Day 3: CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, and Git Integration**
- **1. Jenkins Basics:**
  - Refresh your understanding of **Jenkins installation** and **configuration**.
  - Review **folder structure**, **plugin management**, and **job creation** within Jenkins.
  - Deep dive into **Jenkins pipelines** and how to integrate them with **GitHub** for CI/CD workflows.
  - Hands-on: Create a **Jenkins pipeline** to automate the provisioning and decommissioning of GCP resources using **Terraform**.

- **2. Docker Basics and Integration with Jenkins:**
  - Review **Dockerfile creation**, including the use of various **Dockerfile commands** (e.g., `COPY`, `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`).
  - Understand how to **build Docker images** and push them to **Google Container Registry** (GCR) using Jenkins pipelines.
  - Hands-on: Create a **Dockerfile**, build an image, and automate the process using Jenkins pipelines.

- **3. Git Integration and Version Control:**
  - Review **Git concepts** (commits, branches, merges, etc.) and **GitHub integration** in Jenkins.
  - Hands-on: Integrate **GitHub repositories** with Jenkins to trigger builds for **Terraform**, **Docker**, and **Ansible** automation.

---

#### **Day 4: Ansible Automation and Configuration Management**
- **1. Ansible Basics:**
  - Revise your knowledge of **Ansible inventory**, **configuration files**, and **playbooks**.
  - Hands-on: Create a **control VM** and **managed VMs** using **Terraform**, and use **Ansible** for configuration management.

- **2. SSH and Ansible:**
  - Review how **SSH** works for remote communication with **Ansible-managed VMs**.
  - Deep dive into **ssh-agent**, **key-based authentication**, and how to securely manage SSH keys.
  - Hands-on: Set up **SSH-based authentication** between your control and managed VMs, and troubleshoot any connectivity issues that arise.

- **3. Ansible Playbook Troubleshooting:**
  - Review common **errors** and **troubleshooting steps** when working with **Ansible playbooks**.
  - Hands-on: Run an **Ansible playbook** on your managed VM and document **error handling** and **playbook optimization**.

---

#### **Day 5: Terraform Advanced Concepts & Final Revision**
- **1. Advanced Terraform:**
  - Revisit advanced concepts like **Terraform state management**, **remote backends** (GCS), and **modules** (e.g., for VPCs, instances, and firewalls).
  - Understand how to use **Terraform workspaces** for managing different environments (dev, staging, production).
  - Hands-on: Build **multi-environment infrastructures** using workspaces and remote backends.

- **2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and Jenkins:**
  - Review the **concept of Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) and how Terraform integrates with **Jenkins**.
  - Hands-on: Set up a **Jenkins job** to run **Terraform** commands for infrastructure management (creation, modification, and destruction).
  - Revisit the process of **storing Jenkins output in GCS** and automating **Terraform apply** and **destroy** actions in Jenkins pipelines.

- **3. Final Review and Documentation:**
  - Revise the overall flow of all the tools (Terraform, Jenkins, Ansible, Docker) and how they integrate into a seamless **CI/CD pipeline**.
  - Ensure that you have clear and comprehensive **documentation** of all the technical work and processes you've learned.
  - Create or update the **revision notes** and **documentation** in your Git repository for each tool and technique you've learned.
